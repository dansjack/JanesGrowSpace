      <h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>
      <ul class="tips">
        <li><p>If you have trouble overwatering your plants, try using a water mister instead</p></li>
        <li><p>Not all plants are created equal! A location for one plant may not work for others, so do your
            research</p></li>
        <li><p>Rotate your plants a half-turn once a week to promote even growth</p></li>
        <li><p>Insects and other pests love dead foliage, make sure to remove dead leaves from your plants</p></li>
        <li><p>
          If you don't know if it's time to water a plant, stick your finger in the soil; if the first half-inch is
          dry, it's time to water
        </p></li>
        <li><p>If you use a moisture thermometer, make sure to wipe it off after each use to prevent rust buildup</p></li>
        <li><p>The best water to use is rain water. Generally, tap water contains impurities that can build up in the
            soil</p></li>
        <li><p>Over time, your soil will become compacted. Make sure to aerate your soil by poking holes in it with a
            chopstick</p></li>
        <li><p>
          When using a new fertilizer for the first time, use less than the recommended amount. Some fertilizers are
          more concentrated than others and you may burn your leaves if you over-fertilize
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Some plants need to be propped up (e.g. Monstera deliciosa). Try to use natural materials like bamboo
            stakes</p></li>
      </ul>
