Loves cheeseburgers meowing chowing and wowing or if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard. Meow and walk away intently stare at the same spot, and eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap wack the mini furry mouse try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall. Ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box attack the child and lick yarn hanging out of own butt. Steal the warm chair right after you get up cats secretly make all the worlds muffins, a nice warm laptop for me to sit on and sleeps on my head, i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box.
