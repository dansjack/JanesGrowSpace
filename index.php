      My name is Dan and I'm currently in school full-time for web and software development. When I'm
      not studying I'm probably hanging out at home with my wife and our two cat babies Gil and Winnie.

      I'm looking forward to learning about both development and design. I have ideas about how to solve
      problems with certain software as well as user experiences online. I'm excited to get to a point
      where I can try to do something about it! Recently I began to explore the Twitter API
      through <a href="http://www.tweepy.org/">Tweepy</a>. I'd like to make an app that helps you quickly identify
      Twitter TOS violations and report them.
