      My name is Dan and I'm currently in school full-time for web and software development. When I'm
      not studying I'm probably hanging out at home with my wife and our two cat babies Gil and Winnie.

    <p>
      I'm looking forward to learning about both development and design. I have ideas about how to solve
      problems with certain software as well as user experiences online. I'm excited to get to a point
      where I can try to do something about it! Recently I began to explore the Twitter API
      through <a href="http://www.tweepy.org/">Tweepy</a>. I'd like to make an app that helps you quickly identify
      Twitter TOS violations and report them.
